# List

# We have list of cat breeds and put it in array
cat = ["Maincoon", "Persia", "British shorthair"]

# You can store multiple value in variable cat, for example i will change the first value in variable cat

# cat[0] = "Aegean"
# print(cat)

# Or you can simply append or remove any value in cat variable

# This will append Bengal into variable cat and put it in last array
# cat.append("Bengal") 

# You can remove any value in variable cat 
# cat.remove("Persia")

# This will remove the last element
# cat.pop()

# This allow you to add value in any list of index
# cat.insert(0, "Bambino") # Which mean i put value Bambino into index 0 in array

# This will sort list automatically
# cat.sort() # Sort will start from a-z

# And you can also remove all the value in cat variable
# cat.clear() # This will not print anything

# print(cat)

# and ofc you can make loop from variable cat
for c in cat: # This will print all value in variable cat and put it into c variable
    print(c) # Then we show that value in variable c into console
